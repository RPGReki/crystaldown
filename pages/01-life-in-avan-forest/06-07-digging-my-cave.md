After returning to my camp, I start planning my cave.
Actually, I want it to be more like a house: an entrance area that functions as a living room, a bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen.
I think I'll need a workshop as well.
I experiment with several ideas I have.
In the end, I settle for the plan with a big entrance area in the centre that doubles as a living room.
That way I can expand it when I feel like adding more than the most necessary rooms.
That seems way too cozy for a cave.
No matter, I'll just have the best life I can have with a cave!
The sun has already set.
Time sure flies when you're busy!
My interface says it's {% include ruby base=base text=text %}.
Anyway, I put more wood into the fire to keep it burning.

I open another Lottery Box of Food.
This time I receive some Onigiri. Oh, the tuna is so tasty!
Since I've nothing to do, I observe the clock in my interface.
I think the minutes are slightly shorter than in my previous life.
But with the hours having {% include ruby base="60" text="seventy-two" %} minutes, the hours feel about the same length.

I set up some Barrier Crystals. As one could guess from the name, it sets up a temporary barrier.
That shield should protect my camp against wild animals for the night.
I get into the tent and get the blankets from the Infinite Storage and fold several of them to make a makeshift mattress and pillow and lie down to sleep.
Or at least I try to.

I need to go to the loo. I totally forgot about that…
I leave my tent and try to look for a suitable place.
This should be far enough away.

*“Displace Earth!”*

I dig a hole in the ground.
Yes, it's going to be a pit toilet. I don't really have a choice right now.
Now I need a seat.

*“Compaction!”*

There, I'm done!
Now the toilet paper I received turns out to be quite a boon.
After I finish my business, I wash my hands at the river and return to my tent.
But I can't sleep… I need to calm down!
I want to sleep now so I can get up early tomorrow!

{% scene_break leaves %}

I don't know when I've fallen asleep, but I've just woken up.
My back is hurting; I guess this world is real after all!
I'm in a new world — there's a whole new world for me to explore!
My clock tells me it's 09:04. I store the blankets and leave the tent.
The sun has already risen.
It's another sunny day.
Let's open another Lottery Box of Food and see what's for breakfast today: I get a bowl of hot cup noodles.
It's even my favourite brand! And it's already made.
And it also comes with chopsticks!
Slurp… So it's so tasty!

After washing my face at the nearby river, it's time to start digging my cave.
I should start with the entrance area.
I imagine a chunk the size of the entrance room, breaking down and touch the cliff.

*“Grind!”*

A nasty feeling of cold comes down my spine.
I immediately jump back a few steps.
Good thing I do. A wave of sand rushes towards me.
I should have thought of that!
This Danger Sense skill is quite useful!
What do I do now? Moving all the sand is going to take a while…
If I could only make it vanish somewhere!

Can I put it into my Infinite Storage?
I grab a small portion of sand and try to put it into my Infinite Storage.
The sand vanishes. Success!
I open the Infinite Storage.
The sand uses up one space.
I have a closer look at the item description.

{:.interface}
> Item: Fine Sand
>
> {% include ruby base="18" text="twenty" %} dr of fine sand.
>

Now, what happens if I store another a handful of sand?
The sand still uses up only one single space.
Great! I put all the sand into my Infinite Storage.
Now, I have created a big hole in the cliff.
I totally forgot I need a wall!
So I want a wall with a hole for a door.
The door should be three times as wide and one and a half times as high as I am.
The outside wall itself should be about as wide as my height.
I go to the mouth of the cave and take out a generous amount of sand from my Infinite Storage.
I can use this for building that wall.
That way I should even be able to make it look like I didn't forget the wall in the first place!
I stretch my hand out.

*“Compaction!”*

The sand compacts and forms a thick wall.
Judging from how it went yesterday, it should harden quickly.
After it's finally done, I go out and admire my work.
This isn't any good. This looks totally unnatural!
It's a block of uniform sandstone in the middle of the cliff!
I need a method to make it look like a natural cliff again.
I need the layers. I think I can do that by compacting more at the correct places.

*“Further Compaction!”*

There, now I have layers. It looks almost perfect.
I just need to weather the surface.

*“Weathering!”*

Yep, it finally looks as if I carved out the door first.
Actually, why bother if it's so easy to place a wall wherever I need it?
Next, I should be working on the kitchen.
The kitchen should only be half as wide as the living room is.
Like with the living room, I start digging and turn rock to sand and put it into my Infinite Storage.
Just this time, I grind smaller blocks until the hole reaches the size I want.
It takes longer, but the sand doesn't drop onto me.

*“Grind! Grind!”*

After I'm done, I re-erect a wall, separating the kitchen from the living room.
That has been more work than I expected.
But now, I have two rooms.
I want to have a campfire in my place, but I'm worried about smoke and suffocating.
The room should be big enough.
But to be sure, I need a way to exhaust the smoke and draw in the fresh air.

I need a chimney!
Carefully, I break the needed tunnel starting at the back wall of the living room all the way to the top of the cliff.
Now I get some sand from the Infinite Storage and create a chimney mantle.

*“Fine Compaction!”*

That's a different spell!
I think it's because this time I want a smooth surface and not a cliff finish.
But the spell takes just as long as the other one…
And it's finally done! Let's try lighting a fire.

*“Smoulder!”*

I put in some wood and light the fire.
I manage to do it in half the time I needed yesterday.
The chimney seems to work: the fire burns better than a simple campfire.
I'm worried about things falling through the chimney into the fireplace, but I'll take care of that later when I'm more comfortable with this body.
I don't feel like falling due to missing coordination.
I might be a cat boy, but that doesn't mean I can fall from heights without injuries like a cat.
Though that would be nice.
I wonder if there's a risk-free way to test that out…

Time to break a tunnel at the back of the kitchen as well, I want to put the oven there.
Come to think of it, before I dig out more rooms, I need some furniture.
Well, I still have lots of sand, so I just make some from stone.
Let's start with something simple: a table in the living room.

*“Compaction!”*

A stone table forms. This is way too easy!
And now a chair. I sit on the newly made chair.
Of course, it doesn't have a cushion, but still, it's a chair.
I'd make a bed as well, but I'm not strong enough to carry a stone bed…
Wait, I can just store it! I go into a corner of the room and create a bed.

*“Compaction!”*

{% assign text = "thirteen,,fifty-three" | split: "," %} {% assign base = "11,:,45" | split: "," %}
Just like yesterday, I make a makeshift mattress and pillow from the blankets I have.
Back in the kitchen, I create a table and a stove.
An oven might come later if I feel like it.

That will have to do for now.
According to my interface, it's {%include ruby base=base text=text %}.
I've gotten quite hungry.
Let's see what I get for lunch — I open another Lottery Box of Food — and I receive a pepperoni pizza.
And it's already cut.
That's a good thing since I don't have any cutlery yet.
Either the boxes take care of your circumstances or my Lucky Devil trait is working overtime.
Anyway, I should take care of getting cutlery soon.
But first, I need to consume this very delicious smelling pizza. Oh, it's yummy!
But I'm not that hungry, so I leave slices some for later.
