Enough crafting for the day, it's time to survey the area.
I leave my cave and dismantle the tent and put the parts into my Infinite Storage.
After that, I take a look around.
The cliff seems only about a few hundred meters wide, meaning if I walk a little I can get on top of the cliff without climbing.
On top of the cliff, a beautiful meadow spreads out.

I find the holes in the ground are my chimney tunnels.
I get some sand from my Infinite Storage and create cowls and put them on top.
Done! Now I neither need to worry about things dropping through the holes nor wind pushing smoke downwards.

I eye a crystal the size of my fist nearby.
It's a deep green emerald.
I try to pick it up, but it's as if it's rooted to the ground: I can't move it all.
The crystal starts shining brightly.
It's blinding.
I have to close my eyes.
After the light dies down, I open my eyes again.
The emerald has turned colourless.
What happened?
Do I have an event log?
No, it doesn't look like it.
Out of options, I analyze the colourless crystal.

So I must have gained a skill or a trait.
Let me see… I open my character window.

{% include character-window character="swift-1-8" %}

I think I have gained the Forest Magic skill.
Neat! I think I also got the title “Druid”.
I think I can use that to hide the entrance to my cave.
Excited, I analyze one of the other crystals.

Weak Constitution?
So traits and skills aren't always beneficial?
I analyze the next crystal.

Permanent Invisibility? That's terrible!
I guess I have to thank my Lucky Devil trait that I happened to pick up something useful.

I have a closer look at the meadow.
There are awakening crystals spread all over.
I have a look at several other crystals.
I sigh… If they don't have detrimental effects, they have traits or skills I already have.
I give up. Given my current sample size, I don't think it's worth looking at more crystals right now.
Anyway, let's go back to the cave.
At my cave, I use my newly acquired Forest Magic to grow ivy to hide the entrance.

*“Growth!”*

But having ivy only in front of the entrance is too conspicuous!
So I grow more ivy across the whole cliff.
To make sure I can find the entrance, I put two boulders to several meters away from the entrance near the cliff.
Satisfied with my work, I enter my cave.
There's pizza waiting for me!
