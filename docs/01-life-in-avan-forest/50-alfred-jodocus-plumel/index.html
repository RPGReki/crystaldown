After pondering for longer than I want to admit, I decide to call it Alfred, Alfred Jodocus Plumel, similar to a famous cartoon duckling in my childhood. Even the only thing those two have in common is the chick yellow colour… and they’re both poultry. «Your name shall be Alfred. I hope we get along.» «Thanks, master. I’m sure we will.» Wow! He does sound like Alfred the cartoon duckling! «Please climb on. I’ll bring you wherever you need to go.» «Are you sure? Aren’t you hurt?» «It’s already healed, thanks to master.» «I see.» I climb onto Alfred and direct him to the cave. It’s kinda hard not to fall off. But somehow I manage. I might need a saddle…  " } ]
