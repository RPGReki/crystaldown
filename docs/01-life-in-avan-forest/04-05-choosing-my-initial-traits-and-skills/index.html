Blessings Traits Skills That’s a very bare character window. As I said before, there are no character levels. Currently, I have no traits but Menu, Mystic Eye of Analysis, Mystic Eye of Knowledge and Infinite Storage. I have no titles or blessings. I guess the Menu traits are functions in my gaming interface. From reading the glossary entries of my races, I would have guessed I’d have some racial traits. So they didn’t even choose those for me. But that just means I don’t have any existing traits to consider when choosing my initial traits and skills. So let’s have a look at the racial traits I can choose from. Book of Choice: Racial Trait Choose one racial trait from this fixed selection. Ailuranthrope Racial Traits Accelerated Recovery: increases recovery speed of all kinds Adaptability: temporarily increases status of choosing Feline Form: provides ability to shapeshift into a feline Neotes Racial Traits Mastery Obsession: increases maximum skill level to level 10 Quick Learner: increases learning speed Lucky Devil: increases luck by greatly Neat! Let’s see. Since I have four books, I can choose four of those. To maximize my survival chances, I’m going with Accelerated Recovery, Feline Form, Quick Learner, and Lucky Devil. Let’s have a look at the regular traits I can choose from next. Book of Choice: Trait Choose one trait from this fixed selection. Adrenaline Rush: boost increases speed when health is low Appealing Charisma: increases charisma by a big amount ⋮ Book Smart: increases understanding of theories ⋮ Nimbleness: increases agility Nimble and Precise: increases agility and dexterity ⋮ I can choose two of these. Again, to maximize my survival chances, I’m going with Appealing Charisma and Nimble &amp; Precise. The latter sound like a typical trait that thieves have, though in this day and age, you’d rather call them specialists for spontaneous involuntary ownership transfer. I can’t say I dislike the sound of the latter term. Every job sounds better if it’s called a specialist! Let’s have a look that the skill I can choose from. Book of Choice: Skills Choose one skill to gain at level 1 from this fixed selection. ⋮ Meta-Skills Fighting Skills Magic Skills Production Skills Survival Skills I quickly scroll over the categories to get an overview. Meta-skills? Wait a minute… I cancel the selection and try choosing a skill to master. Book of Choice: Skill Mastery Choose one skill to gain at maximum level from this fixed selection. ⋮ Meta-Skills Fighting Skills Magic Skills Production Skills Survival Skills I can choose two skills to master and it looks like I can master meta-skills. I grin. I guess I’ve found my cheat! It’d been even better if I had chosen Mastery Obsession earlier… I mean I finally get to live in an RPG world and completely forgot about min-maxing! Something I tend to do. I should have put more thought into that… Well, It’s no use crying over spilled juice! So which ones do I choose? Survival Skills sound good. Let me check. Book of Choice: Skill Mastery ⋮ Survival Skills Camping Danger Sense Fishing Foraging Presence Detection Presence Isolation Trap Detection Trap Disarming Trap Setting Stealth Weakness Detection ⋮ For some reason, half of the skills in this skill tree sound like thief skills. Anyway, I’ll go with that. I think I’m good with survival chances, so I should be choosing some other skills as well. Magic sounds nice. Now that I’ve spent my skill masteries, I spend the remaining books to get all fighting and production skills at level one. I should take a look at my character window now. Character Info Name:   Age:   Race:   Titles &amp; Blessings Traits Skills What’s this? While most of the maximum level skills are level X (ten), some of those skills are level E (eleven). My guess is one of my traits increases the skill level limit on those. I have magic skills now, plus I have the Camping skill on level X (ten). I should try making a campfire. I should be able to build a campfire using magic. But I still don’t have any idea how to do it. I don’t know even how to use magic at all… Let’s try it, anyway, creating a stone frame… I touch the ground. A certain phrase comes to my mind. “Compaction!” A cloud of sand forms in the shape of a ring around where I touch the ground. I feel it’d too small and shallow for a campfire if that sand were to compact to stone. So I imagine a slightly bigger and higher stone frame. The ring changes size and the sand slowly compacts to stone. Yeah, this looks like the stone frame of a typical campfire. Is it done? No, something in my mind tells me it’s not. So I keep at it. After I get the feeling it’s finally done, I stop and put in some wood. Now I need to light it. I could just ignite the wood directly. What could go wrong? I put my hands over the wood and imagine fire: hot and blazing. I mutter the word that suddenly comes into my mind. “Blaze!” Oh! I get startled and flinch. Good thing I do. The next moment I see a flash and all the wood I put in has combusted. The smell of burnt wood fills the air. That was dangerous! I should be more careful. Let’s try again. I put in some more wood. This time I put in some tinder as well. I should light it carefully. I put my hand over the tinder and imagine it smouldering. “Smoulder!” After a while, it starts glowing and smoking. Now, I can either fan it until it turns into a fire or I pour more energy into it until it turns into a fire. Let’s do the latter. I imagine slowly putting in more energy into the smouldering. It intensifies. The wood also starts smouldering on the place where it touches. After spreading for a while, it starts burning. Neat, I have made fire! I sit down and admire my creation. It was surprisingly difficult. Good thing I started early. Due to the mishap just now, I’m almost out of wood. I need to gather more. I go back into the forest and gather lumber. I can’t help but notice the animals in the forest now, I guess it must be because of to the skills I gained. Since I’m not feeling any danger from them I ignore them for now. I like the atmosphere of this forest. Maybe I should settle down here! The cliff where my tent currently is seems to be a good place to dig a cave. Let’s do that tomorrow!  " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-hidden> Choosing My Initial Traits and Skills </h1> <div class="d-none" id="talkify-title" aria-flowto="talkify-metadata"> <p>0xReki's Adventures by Night<p> <p>Crystal Down 1, Life in Avan Forest, Chapter 4: Choosing My Initial Traits and Skills<p> </div> <div id="talkify-metadata" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left"> published on 2019-12-06, last updated on 2021-06-11 </small> <small class="float-right"> written by , checked with , edited by </small> <div class="clearfix"></div> <small > As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <div class="d-inline-flex w-100 mt-2"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="⏸&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;▶️" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Setting up Camp and Discovering Numbers" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/03-setting-up-camp-and-discovering-numbers/">Setting up Camp and Discovering Numbers</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Digging My Cave" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/06-07-digging-my-cave/">Digging My Cave</a> </nav> </header> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>I sit down and take a look at my character information. <!--more--></p> <blockquote class="interface " style="order: 20"> <p onclick="toggleAccordion(this)" class="inactive">Character Info</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Name: <td>  <tr> <td>Age: <td>  <tr> <td>Race: <td>  </table> <blockquote class="interface"> <p onclick="toggleAccordion(this)" class="inactive">Titles &amp;
